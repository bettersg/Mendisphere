The change manifested within then radiates outwards — from the core to the shell—inside to the outside—enabling you to care for and serve those around you better—to become a more effective and aware mental wellness care-giver and wellness guide for others in the community.\nWellbeing Champions can undergo a set of four foundational modules that form the core of OTR’s teachings for the Wellbeing Champion: Mental Health 101, Self-Care 101, Others Care 101, and Psychological First Aid 101.\nFind out more here: "
